/**
 * \ingroup wifi
 * \brief ARF Rate control algorithm
 *
 * This class implements the so-called ARF algorithm which was
 * initially described in <i>WaveLAN-II: A High-performance wireless
 * LAN for the unlicensed band</i>, by A. Kamerman and L. Monteban. in
 * Bell Lab Technical Journal, pages 118-133, Summer 1997.
 *
 * This implementation differs from the initial description in that it
 * uses a packet-based timer rather than a time-based timer as described
 * in XXX (I cannot find back the original paper which described how
 * the time-based timer could be easily replaced with a packet-based
 * timer.)
